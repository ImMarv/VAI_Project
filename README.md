# Vendor Application Interface
This is an assignment made for our Software Engineering project.
This is a project entirely made in C# with Winforms. We learned a lot of new things about software engineering, along with the multiple struggles that come with it, and as a result, we managed to produce this piece of software

It still needs a lot of polishing, which we may apply in our free time. 

Long story short, this is a Vendor Application Inventory Platform, a type of application used by suppliers to manage their vendors.
